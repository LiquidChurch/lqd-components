# The Liquid Components Readme

## What Is?
Each top level folder within the Liquid Components project is a complete plugin that performs some
common function of a WP plugin. With minimal work they should be able to run independently of one
another. They can be easily integrated together to create greater plugins with substantial functionality.

These were created as part of the process of building Liquid Notes, a WP plugin, but can also be used
for creating new projects with ease.
